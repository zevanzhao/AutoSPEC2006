# AutoSPEC2006
A small script designed for searching the best optimization flags for SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks

# Introduction
SPEC CPU is one of the most comprehensive processor performance benchmark program. Though SPEC CPU 2006 was released in 2006, it is still widely used.
Proper choice of optimization flags plays an important role in the benchmarking, especially for the peak benchmarking. 
Howerver, there are hundreds of optimization options for compilers. It is almost impossile to find the best combination for the optimization flags.
Here I wrote a script to perform SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark. This script will find a good candidate combination for the optimization flags automatically.
